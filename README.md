My simple and static website for personal professionality.

## Why is it just plain HTML and CSS?

I wanted to work with simple text files.

I considered a simple templating engine. But, all templating engines require
too much setup (for a simple, static website).

I would like a templating engine that's similar to a C compiler: a program that
runs without any other dependencies and 'makes' my what I want it to 'make'
(in this case HTML files out of template files).

That doesn't exist, so I decided to stick with just plain HTML files.
